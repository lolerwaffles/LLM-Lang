# LLM-IR Interpreter Architecture Outline

## 1. Lexer
- Tokenizes the source code into a compact, symbolic stream
- Removes whitespace and comments

## 2. Parser
- Converts tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Expression-oriented, handles prefix/infix/postfix forms
- Supports array and function literals

## 3. Borrow Checker
- Performs static borrow checking on AST nodes
- Validates ownership rules similar to Rust

## 4. Module Loader
- Resolves and imports `.llmir` modules
- Caches and links modules with alias names

## 5. Intermediate Representation (IR) Builder
- Converts AST to an intermediate form optimized for LLVM
- Annotates types and memory semantics

## 6. Scheduler
- Distributes parallel jobs based on affinity hints
- Supports multithreaded execution with isolation enforcement

## 7. Runtime (Optional)
- Provides basic services: memory allocation, messaging, debugging
- Can be omitted for fully static output

## 8. LLVM Backend
- Emits LLVM IR for compilation and execution
- Interfaces with `llc`/`clang` or JIT runtime (e.g. LLVM Orc)

## 9. Debugger Interface
- Maps token positions to LLVM instructions
- Enables symbolic stepping and tracing
